# **NextJS - Universal JavaScript Application**

### Pro
  - write less configuration (webpack etc)
  - code splitting out of the box
  - no need to add `React` import to each react component
  - pre fetch, used only in production. This will prefetch any component its applied to

### Con
  - can only see us easy SSR and code splitting, which can easily be done
  - param url (:id) configuration is strange
